  - Turned off the debugging by default (from -extradebug) but left it in.
  - Turn debugging output on/off with
      /script LiteAssist_SetDebug(true)
      /script LiteAssist_SetDebug(false)
  - Fixed the texture offsets for the target frame icon so you don't get
    a thin black line below the icon in some circumstances.

Version 1.4-extradebug - 4-Apr-2007
  - Added a heap more debugging messages.

Version 1.4 - 13-Mar-2007
  - Fixes a situation where raid/party member changes in combat would
    cause the assist target icon to show at the wrong times for the duration
    of that combat.
  - Add assist-change hook functions to allow TitanLiteAssist to work.
  - Allow the unitid stuff to work with focus -- mostly useful to allow
    me to debug when not grouped.

Version 1.3 - 11-Mar-2007
  - If your assist is in your party/raid, keep track of their unit ID
    as well as their name.
  - Use the UnitId of party/raid assists to show an icon on the target
    frame (crossed swords) if your target is also your assist's target.
  - Adds {LiteAssistUnitId} in macros to set the unitid if we know it, if
    not this will be set to "none" (so it's not that useful).
  - Updates the learned macro when you edit the macro and when the
    unitid changes.  If this happens in combat, queues it for when
    you leave combat (PLAYER_REGEN_ENABLED event).
  - Removed ClearAssist() function internally and replaced it with
    SetAssist(nil).
  - Warn if the macrotext gets too long.

Version 1.2 - 02-Mar-2007
  - If the player creates a macro named LiteAssistMacro and includes
    the string {LiteAssistUnit} in it, then the learnt command will
    be that macro with {LiteAssistName} replaced by the player name
    you learnt.

Version 1.1 - 25-Jan-2007
  - Recode to use macro approach to assist.  In essence the assist function
    now just does "/assist PlayerName".  Blizzard's protecting of the
    assist function has made support for unit tokens a huge inconsistent
    mess and they aren't inclined to answer my questions.
  - Focus turned out to be impractical.  There's only one focus, and
    too many things wanting to use it (because it's the only sensible
    way to do many things now).
  - Don't need the learning SecureActionButtons now, but I've kept them in
    order to make it easier to do more later when/if Blizzard make more
    changes.
  - If you assist your pet, it will use "pet" instead of the name as the
    thing to assist, so you can change/resummon your pet and it'll still
    retain the assist.
  - Learn alert message says "Pet" if you assist pet.
  - Use UnitCanAssist() to check who we can assist.  Allows assisting
    NPCs in (for example) escort quests.

Version 1.0rc3 - 12-Dec-2006
  - Fix bug where for some users the alert frame never gets resized
    so they don't see the alert messages about learning and clearing.

Version 1.0rc2 - 11-Dec-2006
  - Updated TOC for WoW 2.0.3
  - Learn done via buttons of type macro.

Version 1.0rc1 - 21-Dec-2006 
  - Initial version released.
